### Creating a Cohere Account

- Go to the [Cohere website](https://cohere.com/) and sign up.
- Verify your account as instructed.

### Creating a Cohere API Key

- Log into your Cohere account and navigate to the API documentation.
- Create an API key following their guidelines. Check [Cohere's API documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/) for more details.

### Setting the Cohere API Key in .Renviron

To modify the `.Renviron` file:

```r
`#| eval: false require(usethis) edit_r_environ()`
```

For a persistent setting, add the following line to `.Renviron`, replacing `"<APIKEY>"` with your actual Cohere API key:

```bash
COHERE_API_KEY="<APIKEY>"
```

Save the file and restart your R session for the changes to take effect.

**Caution:** Ensure `.Renviron` is not exposed if using version control systems.
